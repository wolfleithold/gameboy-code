## Description

A game I started developing due to a childhood obsession. The game Simple Fish is far from complete and is still a total WIP, but I wanted to track the games progress on github.
This is my first time coding in C, so any advice is much appreciated. The idea of the game? You are a fish, and you are being hunted, dodge the spears to survive as long as you can. Thats it!

## Installation

This game requires bgb which is a Game Boy emulator for the computer. It can be downloaded [here](https://bgb.bircd.org).

## Usage

To run the game, simply drag the main.gb file into the bgb emulator!
